      <p> Title: Link Between Clinically Diagnosed Mental Illnesses and Social Media Consumption </p>

        <p>   The link between social media consumption and the adverse effects it may have on mental illness is a matter which has been brought to the spotlight in recent years.
            Due to the fact that mental illnesses are difficult to objectivly categorize and document, whilst social media is a relitavely new form of engadgement with little long-term research-analysis - it
            has proven difficult to find a direct correlation between the two. Never-the-less, I believe with the appropriate datasets and visualization tools, we can begin to decipher the link.
