        <p> I find this graph the most interesting of all the provided examples. I would want to expand the dataset by finding more languages such as German, French and Arabic. I’m also interested in finding out if i can subdivide the current data for the languages, and identify which region of the world it is originating from, for example, whether the Spanish is coming from Latin America, South America, or Europe. I’d also like to redesign the language buttons so that it sits on the right side of the graph as opposed to above it - I believe this will look more visuallyw appealing and make the graph and button’s utilities more clear.
